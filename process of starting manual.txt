How to get the 4 named PowerShell tabs (manual, reliable)

Open 4 separate PowerShell windows (run as Administrator). Rename their title bars (optional) so you remember which is which:

Admin (top-left) — run these:

cd "M:\CCNS project work\project\iot-botnet-simulation"
docker-compose up -d
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Image}}\t{{.Status}}"


MQTT (top-right) — to watch telemetry and publish:

cd "M:\CCNS project work\project\iot-botnet-simulation"
# to capture just one telemetry message:
docker-compose exec mosquitto mosquitto_sub -t 'devices/data' -C 1
# OR keep a running subscriber:
# docker-compose exec mosquitto mosquitto_sub -t 'devices/data'


C2 logs (bottom-left):

cd "M:\CCNS project work\project\iot-botnet-simulation"
docker logs -f iot-botnet-simulation-c2-1 --tail=200


Victim logs (bottom-right):

cd "M:\CCNS project work\project\iot-botnet-simulation"
docker logs -f victim --tail=200


If you want an Admin2 extra tab for manual commands (publishing attack or any admin task), open a fifth PowerShell window and keep it ready:

cd "M:\CCNS project work\project\iot-botnet-simulation"
# publish if needed:
docker-compose exec mosquitto mosquitto_pub -t 'c2/commands' -m 'do_attack'


This manual-tab approach is bulletproof — no complex quoting. The headless script above does the automation (start, capture, attack, copy files). You can run the headless script and have the four windows open to watch activity.
