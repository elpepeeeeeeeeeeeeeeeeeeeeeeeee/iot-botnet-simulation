3. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

This command starts the application along with all necessary services. 

## 🔍 Using the Application

Now that the application is running, you can access the simulation interface through your web browser. 

1. Open your web browser.
2. Go to `http://localhost:8080` to view the application dashboard.
3. Here, you can start creating and monitoring IoT devices.

## 📊 Understanding the Simulation

The application allows you to:

- Simulate various IoT devices interacting on a network.
- Monitor network traffic using built-in tools.
- Visualize how these devices can be exploited by a botnet.

### 🕵️‍♂️ Monitoring Network Traffic

Use the provided monitoring tools to analyze the communication between devices. This feature will help you understand vulnerabilities and how to protect against them.

## 📚 Additional Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed for easy navigation.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Watch live data as it flows through the network.
- **Educational Resources**: Access tutorials and documentation within the application.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting
